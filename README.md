Project: Giphy Search Engine | Favorite 'Saturday Night Live' Cast Member

Author: Michael Benefiel

Why I created this project:

Homework for the University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp.

Feel free to use some or all of this code if you're trying to complete a similar project.

THE PROJECT

Bootstrap 4.1.2 jQuery 3.3.1

- Delcared variables

- generatedButton function loops through array of topics and assigns each one to a button, then appends them to the comedian-view div

- #add-comedian onClick pulls information typed into search box, allows user to hit the submit button and then push the information into a button. There's also a condition set up that restricts a user from pushing a blank button to the comedian-view

- gifButton function uses AJAX call to "talk" with the GIPHY API to pull GIFs into my web app

- Search query set up to only pull 10 GIFs per search

- for loop runs through pulled GIFs

- variable declared to set rating of GIF

- attributes designating still and animated images

- document onClick assigned to GIFs that allows user to click an image for animated effect, and click again for original/still effect.
